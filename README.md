# Weather Prediction

Predict weather based on image that is given to the machine

Dataset: <https://www.kaggle.com/vijaygiitk/multiclass-weather-dataset>

After downloading the dataset and unzip it, place the `dataset` folder in the
**same level directory** with the Python and Jupyter codes.

You can directly use `train_images_features.csv` and `test_images_features.csv`
into the machine learning model instead of run `dataframe_generator.ipynb` again.
